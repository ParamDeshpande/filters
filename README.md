# filters

The given files run kalman filter by using gcc

Matlab_codes
Contains codes which i have used for debugging, analysis, and experimentation for various fileters like MADFilters , complimentary ,  kalman kalman6d  ... .

The files are expected to be imported inside matlab named as "Untitled"(in most files) or any terms according to the files(usually columns of that term would be assgned to elements).
Care needs to be taken while maintaining/importing the dimensions of the filter_inputs and should 
be modified appropriately if needed.


The files inside kalman folder is the entire workspace, contains both bugs and clean codes(not recommended) as a worst case reference .
